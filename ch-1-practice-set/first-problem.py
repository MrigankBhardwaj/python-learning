# Problem -  Write a program to print Twinkle Twinkle little star peom in python 
# Approach - For this we generally use print method of pyhton and used it to print the poem
# Here is two cases -
# First one - that we use triple single double quote to print the multiline poem at once
# Second one - that we print every line - this is not veru feasable so I am going to use first method
print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark,
How could he see where to go,
If you did not twinkle so?

In the dark blue sky you keep,
Often through my curtains peep
For you never shut your eye,
Till the sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark
Lights the traveler in the dark,
Though I know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.""")
